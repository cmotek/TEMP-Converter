# TEMP-Converter
ITC 250 TEMP CONVERTER

This was a small project for a class at Seattle Central College. The Temp Converter works (changing between Kelvin, Celsius and Fahrenheit) however if you do not have PHP configured locally on your machine, you will be unable to run it. 

The following is a shorthand guide for running PHP locally on a Windows machine:

- Download PHP and update your PATH user or system variable to wherever you stored your PHP files (you can test with the command php -v to determin what version you are running)
- Download XAMPP and run the XAMPP Control Center. Turn on Apache and SQL servers 
- Place your PHP project files into the htdocs folder in your XAMPP folder
- Type localhost/dashboard to see your PHPAdmin area (if you use SQL) or type localhost/(the name of your PHP project directory)/(the name of your index file) into your web browser to view your project

All of this can be a little tricky and time consuming if you have never run PHP locally, and it may be necessary to tweak the configuration based upon the specs of your machine
